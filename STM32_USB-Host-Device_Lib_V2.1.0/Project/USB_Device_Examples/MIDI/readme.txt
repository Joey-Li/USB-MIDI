@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the USB OTG Device peripheral 
on the STM32F2xx, STM32F4xx and STM32F105/7 devices.
The STM32 device is enumerated as an USB Device Joystick Mouse, that uses the
native PC Host HID driver.

The Joystick mounted on the STM322xG-EVAL, STM324xG-EVAL and STM3210C-EVAL boards
is used to emulate the Mouse directions.

This example supports remote wakeup (which is the ability of a USB device to bring
a suspended bus back to the active condition), and the key push-button is used as
the remote wakeup source.    
By default, in Windows powered PC the Power Management feature of USB mouse devices
is turned off. This setting is different from classic PS/2 computer functionality. 
Therefore, to enable the Wake from standby option, you must manually turn on the
Power Management feature for the USB mouse.
To manually enable the Wake from standby option for the USB mouse, 
  - start "Device Manager",
  - select "Mice and other pointing devices",
  - select the "HID-compliant mouse" device (make sure that PID &VID are equal to 0x5710 & 0x0483 respectively) 
  - right click and select "Properties", 
  - select "Power Management" tab,
  - finally click to select "Allow this device to wake the system from standby" check box.

This example works
  - in high speed (HS) when the STM322xG-EVAL or the STM324xG-EVAL board and the
    USB OTG HS peripheral are used
  - in full speed (FS) when the STM322xG-EVAL or the STM324xG-EVAL board and the
    USB OTG FS peripheral are used, or when using the STM3210C-EVAL board.


@par Hardware and Software environment 

   - This example runs on STM32F105/7 Connectivity line, STM32F2xx and STM32F4xx devices.
  
   - This example has been tested with STM3210C-EVAL RevB (STM32F105/7 devices), 
     STM322xG-EVAL RevB (STM32F2xx) and STM324xG-EVAL RevB (STM32F4xx)    

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - use CN2 connector to connect the board to a PC host

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use CN8 connector to connect the board to a PC host when using USB OTG FS peripheral
    - Use CN9 connector to connect the board to a PC host when using USB OTG HS peripheral

  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use CN8 connector to connect the board to a PC host when using USB OTG FS peripheral
    - Use CN9 connector to connect the board to a PC host when using USB OTG HS peripheral

@note Known Limitations
      This example retargets the C library printf() function to the EVAL board’s LCD
      screen (C library I/O redirected to LCD) to display some Library and user debug
      messages. TrueSTUDIO Lite version does not support I/O redirection, and instead
      have do-nothing stubs compiled into the C runtime library. 
      As consequence, when using this toolchain no debug messages will be displayed
      on the LCD (only some control messages in green will be displayed in bottom of
      the LCD). To use printf() with TrueSTUDIO Professional version, just include the
      TrueSTUDIO Minimal System calls file "syscalls.c" provided within the toolchain.
      It contains additional code to support printf() redirection.
